# 🚗 Control Systems Projects

Welcome to my repository! Here, I share my work on various **Control Systems** and **Engineering Simulations** using **Julia**, **MATLAB**, and **Simulink**. The repository includes both theoretical studies and practical applications, focusing on areas like **dynamic modeling**, **simulation techniques**, and **control system design**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **Julia**: High performance and flexibility for control systems tasks.
- **MATLAB**: Powerful numerical computation and control systems design tools.
- **Simulink**: A graphical tool to model and simulate complex systems.

I mostly use **Julia** for control systems tasks, but for detailed **modeling** and simulations, I rely on **MATLAB** with **Simulink**.

Feel free to browse through the code, check out the simulations, and explore how these tools can be applied in real-world control system designs! 🚀
