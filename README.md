## üë®‚Äçüíª About Goby Engineering

Welcome to **Goby Engineering**, where I share my work on **Control Systems** and **Systems Modeling**. I‚Äôm **Gal**, a **Mechanical Engineering student** at **Tel Aviv University**. This repository showcases my projects focused on dynamic system modeling, control system design, and simulation techniques.

## üìö Repository Overview

This repository focuses on the study and practical application of **Control Systems** and **Systems Modeling**. You will find various projects that cover:

- **Dynamic Modeling** of mechanical and physical systems
- **Control System Design** focused on stability, optimization, and performance
- **Simulation Techniques** to test and validate system behavior

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **[Julia](https://julialang.org/)**: My primary tool for **control systems analysis**, particularly for modeling **transfer functions** (TF) and **controllers**. Julia is ideal for high-performance computational tasks, offering speed and flexibility.
- **[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)**: Used primarily for **system modeling**‚ÄîMATLAB excels in numerical computation and control system design.
- **[Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html)**: A graphical environment for simulating and modeling dynamic systems, often used alongside MATLAB for system-level modeling and testing.
